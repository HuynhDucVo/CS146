//Problem 1:

1) 10000000000*n^2 vs n^3
We can ignore the coefficient because it does not contribute to the growth.
===> n^3 >
2) n^2*log(n)       vs   n(log(n))^10
log(n^2*log(n))          log(n(log(n))^10)
log(n^2) + log(logn)     logn + log(log(n)^10)
2log(n)  + log(logn)     log(n) + 10log(logn)
We can see that the log factors are too small to consider for the time complexity. 
n^2 log(n) is asymptotically greater because the n^2 grows faster than n
===> n^2*logn >

3) n^logn          vs    2^(sqrt(n))
log(n^logn)              log(2^sqrt*n)
logn * logn              sqrt(n) * log2
log(logn*logn)           log(sqrt(n) * log2)
2log(logn)               1/2 * log(n) + log(log2)
We can see that the log factors are too small to consider for the time complexity
===> 2^(sqrt(n)) >

4) 2^n vs 2^2n
Both are asymptotically equal to each other. 2^(2n) can be rewritten as (2^2)^n.
Since we can treat constants the same, both are asymptotically equivalent to O(2^n).

//Problem 2:
Best case: O(1) when n is 2, 3, or any even number greater than 2
Worst case: O(sqrt(n)) when n is prime or a product of large primes, requiring iteration up to sqrt(n)
Average case: O(sqrt(n)) considering a random large n, although precise average-case analysis may vary based on the distribution of the inputs.
The time complexity of the isPrime(n) function, in terms of big O notation, is O(sqrt(n))  This reflects the worst-case scenario where n is prime, and the algorithm must iterate through all numbers up to sqrt(n) to verify its primality. 
The best case, when n is 2 (the smallest prime number) or any even number (which is immediately identified as non-prime), is O(1), 
but when discussing time complexity in terms of big O notation, we focus on the worst-case scenario unless otherwise specified.
