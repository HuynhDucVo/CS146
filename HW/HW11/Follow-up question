1. Starting Point: Begin at the starting pixel provided by the input.

2. Breadth-First Search (BFS):
  Initialize a queue with the starting pixel.
  While the queue is not empty:
    Dequeue a pixel from the queue.
    Change its color to the target color.
    Enqueue its neighboring pixels that have the same color as the starting pixel.

3. Return Modified Image: Return the modified image after the BFS process is complete.
This approach explores pixels in a level-by-level manner, starting from the starting pixel
and spreading out to its adjacent pixels, similar to how water would fill an area in a flood.
