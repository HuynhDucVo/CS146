Let's consider a graph with 6 vertices (0 to 5) and edges (5 -> 2), (5 -> 0), (4 -> 0), (4 -> 1), (2 -> 3), (3 -> 1).

The graph consists of 6 vertices (0 to 5) and edges as follows:
5 -> 2
5 -> 0
4 -> 0
4 -> 1
2 -> 3
3 -> 1

For the given graph, one possible topological sort could be:
4, 5, 0, 2, 3, 1

Explain: 
Vertex 4 and 5 don't have any incoming edges and can be placed at the beginning.
After removing edges coming from 4 and 5, vertex 0 has no incoming edges, so it comes next.
Then, removing all edges from 4, 5, and 0, vertex 2 becomes the next vertex with no incoming edges.
Following 2, the removal of its edges makes vertex 3 the next in line with no incoming edges.
Finally, vertex 1 is the last, as it now has no incoming edges.
