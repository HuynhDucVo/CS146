Follow-up exercise: Can you think of a way to do this iteratively?
Yes. To invert a binary tree iteratively, we can use a queue to traverse the tree level by level (breadth-first search).
This approach involves swapping the left and right children of each node as we traverse through the tree. 
This iterative solution effectively inverts the binary tree without using the call stack for recursion, making it more efficient in terms of space complexity for very deep trees.
